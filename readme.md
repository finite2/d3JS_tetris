# Tetris

This is a simple re-imagining of the classic game Tetris.  There is single player and four modes of local multi-player. The game can be played [here](https://finite2.github.io/d3JS_tetris).

## Implementation

Elements representing the blocks are all managed using the data driven JavaScript package D3.js.
